🧭 Limited Spectator
======================

A multi-loader Minecraft mod that introduces a restricted spectator mode with configurable limitations.

**Supported Loaders**: NeoForge ✅ • Fabric ✅ • Quilt ✅ (Production Only)


📖 Overview
=============

Limited Spectator allows players to enter a controlled spectator mode that limits what they can do while flying and observing the world.
Unlike the vanilla spectator mode, this version allows to press F1 to show HUD and restricts interactions to preserve game balance on servers or custom worlds.

Perfect for:

• SMP;

• Builders who want visual observation without full spectator privileges.


✨ Features
=============

✅ **Fully Configurable Spectator Mode**
Comprehensive TOML-based configuration system allowing server owners to customize every aspect of spectator behavior.

✅ **Limited Spectator Mode**
Players can enter a custom spectator state that allows free flight but prevents inventory use, PvP, and world interactions.

✅ **Flexible Distance Limits**
Configure maximum travel distance from start position (default 75 blocks) or disable it entirely. Choose between teleport-back or warning behavior.

✅ **Customizable Block Interactions**
Define exactly which blocks players can interact with using Minecraft block IDs. Default includes doors, trapdoors, and fence gates.

✅ **Granular Permission Control**
Set different permission levels (0-4) for `/spectator` and `/survival` commands, with optional OP requirement.

✅ **Selective HUD Visibility**
HUD elements remain hidden by default but can be temporarily shown by pressing F1 (configurable).

✅ **Dimension Travel Control**
Configure whether players can switch dimensions (Nether, End, etc.) while in spectator mode.

✅ **Player Repositioning**
Automatic position reset when exceeding distance limits or executing `/survival` command.

✅ **Flight Capability**
Players in spectator mode can fly by double-pressing the space bar.

✅ **Combat & Interaction Restrictions**
Individually toggle PvP, mob attacks, item drop/pickup, and inventory crafting.

✅ **Hot-Reloadable Configuration**
All settings can be changed in `config/limitedspectator-common.toml` and reloaded with `/reload` command.

✅ **Server-Friendly**
All restrictions are handled server-side for secure multiplayer behavior.

✅ **Multilingual Support**
Full translation support for 5 European languages (English, Italian, German, French, Spanish).

⚙️ Configuration
==================

Limited Spectator features a comprehensive configuration system. On first launch, a config file is automatically generated at:

**Location**: `config/limitedspectator-common.toml`

### Configuration Categories

#### 🚶 Movement Restrictions
- `max_distance` - Maximum travel distance from start position (default: 75.0 blocks, -1 to disable)
- `allow_dimension_travel` - Allow dimension changes in spectator mode (default: false)
- `teleport_back_on_exceed` - Teleport back when exceeding distance vs. warning (default: true)
- `reset_position_on_logout` - Reset position on logout to prevent abuse (default: true)

#### 🎮 Player Abilities
- `enable_invulnerability` - Make players invulnerable (protects from mobs and environmental damage, not fall damage) (default: true)
- `enable_flight` - Allow flight in spectator mode (default: true)
- `spectator_gamemode` - GameMode to use: "ADVENTURE" or "SPECTATOR" (default: "ADVENTURE")

#### 🔧 Interaction Restrictions
- `allow_pvp` - Allow attacking other players (default: false)
- `allow_item_drop` - Allow dropping items (default: false)
- `allow_item_pickup` - Allow picking up items (default: false)
- `allow_inventory_crafting` - Allow inventory crafting (2x2 grid) (default: false)
- `interactable_blocks` - List of block IDs players can interact with (default: all doors, trapdoors, gates)

**Note**: Mob attacks are always disabled because mobs don't target players with `mayfly=true` ability (Minecraft core behavior).

#### 🔐 Command Permissions
- `spectator_command_permission_level` - Permission level for `/spectator` (0-4, default: 0)
- `survival_command_permission_level` - Permission level for `/survival` (0-4, default: 0)
- `require_op_for_spectator` - Require OP status for spectator commands (default: false)

#### 🖥️ Client & HUD Behavior
- HUD automatically hides when entering spectator mode (hard-coded)
- F1 key toggles HUD visibility temporarily

#### 💬 Message Settings
- `use_action_bar_messages` - Show messages in action bar instead of chat (default: true)
- `show_distance_warnings` - Show warnings when approaching distance limit (default: true)

### Example Configurations

**Server with relaxed spectator mode:**
```toml
[movement_restrictions]
  max_distance = -1  # No distance limit
  allow_dimension_travel = true

[interactions]
  allow_item_pickup = true  # Allow picking up items
  interactable_blocks = ["minecraft:oak_door", "minecraft:lever", "minecraft:stone_button"]
```

**Strict survival server:**
```toml
[permissions]
  spectator_command_permission_level = 2  # Requires moderator rank
  require_op_for_spectator = true

[movement_restrictions]
  max_distance = 50.0  # Shorter distance limit
  reset_position_on_logout = true  # Prevent logout abuse
```

All configuration changes can be applied without restarting the server using `/reload`.


🔐 Default Restrictions in Spectator Mode
===========================================

**Note**: Most restrictions below are configurable via `config/limitedspectator-common.toml`

• ❌ No block breaking or placing (enforced by ADVENTURE mode - cannot be changed)

• ❌ No chest, bed, crafting table, or item interactions (configurable via block whitelist)

• ❌ No inventory crafting (2x2 grid) - ingredients restored automatically (configurable)

• ❌ No dimension travel (configurable)

• ❌ No mob attacks (mobs don't target players with mayfly ability)

• ❌ No PvP (configurable)

• ❌ No item dropping or pickup (individually configurable)

• ✅ Doors, trapdoors, and fence gates remain interactable (fully customizable via block IDs)

• ✅ F1 toggles HUD visibility (configurable)

• ✅ Distance limit: 75 blocks (configurable, can be disabled)


🧩 Compatibility
==================

• ✅ Minecraft 1.21.1+

• ✅ NeoForge 21.1.0+

• ✅ Multiplayer-safe

• ⚠️ Limited Spectator uses standard NeoForge event hooks and should be compatible with most mods. However, mods that deeply alter player gamemode handling or HUD rendering may interfere with its behavior.


🌐 Environment Requirements
=============================

Limited Spectator is a **server-authoritative** mod. The Modrinth "Client and server" tag refers to where the mod *can* be installed, not where it is *required*.

| Where to install | Required | Result |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------ |
| **Server**       | ✅ Yes   | All gameplay restrictions (distance limits, item drop/pickup, interactions, attacks, dimension travel, command permissions) are enforced here. The mod cannot function without being on the server. |
| **Client**       | ⚪ Optional but **highly recommended** | Enables a richer UX: HUD auto-hide when entering `/spectator`, F1 toggle for temporary HUD reveal, and tighter sync with world events/interactions. |

### Connection compatibility

- **Vanilla clients can join a server running Limited Spectator.** All restrictions still apply server-side — players just won't get the HUD-hide effect.
- **Clients with Limited Spectator installed** get the full intended experience (clean HUD, synced events).

### Per-loader detail

- **Fabric & Quilt** builds: no client-side code currently exists, so the JAR is effectively server-only. Installing it on the client is harmless but adds no extra features today.
- **NeoForge** build: the only client-side piece is a small optional packet handler for HUD sync. The network channel is registered as **optional**, so connection handshake works against both modded and vanilla clients.

### Recommended setup

| Use case | Server | Client |
| -------- | ------ | ------ |
| Public SMP with vanilla guests | Required | Vanilla works, install for full UX |
| Private server, all members modded | Required | **Install on both for best experience** |
| Single-player testing | n/a | Required (acts as local server) |


🧰 Installation
=================

### 📦 Choose Your Loader

Download the correct version for your mod loader:

| Loader | File | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **NeoForge** | `LimitedSpectator-neoforge-2.0.1.jar` | Full config support |
| **Fabric** | `LimitedSpectator-fabric-2.0.1.jar` | Hardcoded defaults |
| **Quilt** | `LimitedSpectator-quilt-2.0.1.jar` | Uses Fabric API |

### Installation Steps

1. Install your mod loader (NeoForge 21.1.217+ / Fabric 0.16.5+ / Quilt 0.26.4+)
2. Place the correct JAR into your `mods/` folder
3. Launch Minecraft
4. **(NeoForge only)** Config file auto-generates at `config/limitedspectator-common.toml`
5. **(NeoForge only)** Reload changes with `/reload` command

For developers interested in contributing or extending Limited Spectator:

**See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) for:**
- Multi-project Gradle structure
- Build commands for all loaders
- Development workflow
- Code organization & patterns
- Testing procedures
- Contributing guidelines

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/karashi/limitedspectator.git
cd limitedspectator

# Build all loaders
.\gradlew.bat build

# Run NeoForge dev client
.\gradlew.bat :neoforge:runClient
```

**Project Structure:**

- `fabric/` - Fabric-specific implementation
- `quilt/` - Quilt-specific implementation

All three loaders share ~95% of core business logic through `SpectatorManager`.


🧪 Developer / Debug Info
===========================

For debugging, Limited Spectator includes console logs for:

• Player mode changes

• Spectator mode entry/exit

• Interaction blocking

• HUD toggle events

• Packet handling (SpectatorHudPacket)

These logs appear in the console with prefix:
[LimitedSpectator]


🌍 Localization
=================

Limited Spectator includes full translation support for the most common European languages:

The mod automatically detects your Minecraft language setting and displays messages accordingly.


⚠️ Minecraft ADVENTURE Mode Limitations
=========================================

Limited Spectator uses Minecraft's ADVENTURE mode (instead of SPECTATOR mode) to prevent noclip while allowing flight. This design choice introduces some inherent limitations:

### Core Limitations (By Design)

**These are NOT bugs** - they are fundamental restrictions of Minecraft's ADVENTURE mode that cannot be overridden:

1. **Manual Flight Activation**: Players must double-press spacebar to start flying. Auto-start flying requires vanilla SPECTATOR mode (which enables noclip).

2. **Fall Damage Only**: When `mayfly=true`, Minecraft's engine prevents fall damage calculation entirely. However, `enable_invulnerability=true` **DOES protect** against mobs, lava, fire, cacti, and other environmental damage.

3. **Block Breaking/Placing Disabled**: ADVENTURE mode blocks all building actions at the GameMode level. This cannot be changed without deep Mixins into Minecraft's core engine.

### Why These Limitations Exist

Limited Spectator prioritizes **observation without noclip** over feature completeness. Enabling vanilla SPECTATOR mode would allow players to:
- Phase through walls and blocks (noclip)
- Access areas they shouldn't see
- Bypass server protections

These limitations preserve the mod's core purpose: **balanced spectating for servers**.

### Alternative: Use SPECTATOR Mode

If you need full vanilla spectator features (invulnerability, noclip, etc.), set `spectator_gamemode = "SPECTATOR"` in the config. Note that this enables noclip and reduces security for multiplayer servers.
